dart (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove Transformation classes. Their functionality is now included in joint
    classes.
  * Add Featherstone algorithm. Can currently only be used without collision
    handling. The old algortihm is still present and used for that case.
  * Remove kinematics namespace. Functionality is moved to dynamics classes.
  * Add dart root namespace
  * A lot of function and variable renames
  * Add constraint namespace
  * Some parsers, unit tests and apps have not been adapted to the changes yet
    and are therefore currently excluded from building.
  * Add "common" namespace
